### Analysis Summary

I can help you with that! To understand the code structure of your "server" component, I need a little more information.

Could you please clarify what you mean by "server" in your project? For example:

1.  **Is it a specific directory or folder?** If so, what is the path to that directory (e.g., `src/server`, `backend`, `api`)?
2.  **Are there specific files you consider part of the "server"?**
3.  **What kind of server is it (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django/Flask, Java/Spring, Go)?** Knowing the technology might help me infer relevant files.

Once I have a better idea of where your server code resides, I can use my tools to:

*   Get the directory structure of that specific part of your project.
*   Search for key files and components within it.
*   Even summarize individual files if they are central to the server's functionality.

Looking forward to your clarification!

### Implementation Steps

1. **Clarifying the Server Definition**
   The initial step in understanding the server's structure involves clarifying what the user defines as the 'server' within their project. This includes identifying if it's a specific directory, a collection of files, or a particular type of server technology (e.g., Node.js, Python/Django/Flask, Java/Spring, Go). This clarification is crucial for accurately mapping the codebase.

2. **Analyzing the Server Directory Structure**
   Once the 'server' scope is defined, the next step is to leverage tools to analyze the directory structure of the identified server component. This involves mapping out the folders and subfolders to understand the hierarchical organization of the server's codebase.

3. **Identifying Key Server Files and Components**
   Following the directory analysis, the process involves identifying and searching for key files and components within the server's defined scope. This helps in pinpointing the core elements that constitute the server's functionality and architecture.

4. **Summarizing Central Server Files**
   The final step involves summarizing individual files that are central to the server's functionality. This provides a high-level overview of what each critical file contributes to the overall server operation, abstracting away low-level implementation details.
